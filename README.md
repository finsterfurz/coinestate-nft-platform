## 🏗️ Project Overview

CoinEstate NFT is a **community governance platform** for real estate management operating under Cayman Islands regulatory framework. Each NFT represents **voting rights** and **operational control** over specific real estate projects, not securities or investment contracts.

### 🔑 Key Features

- **🗳️ Governance Voting**: NFT holders vote on operational decisions (repairs, contractors, costs)
- **🏛️ Cayman Regulated**: Operates under Cayman Islands Private Fund + Foundation structure
- **🔐 KYC Verified**: Secure identity verification for all participants
- **📊 Transparent Dashboard**: Real-time property performance and governance metrics
- **⚖️ Active Participation**: Voting requirements with reward/penalty system
- **🔄 Transferable Rights**: NFTs can be transferred with proper KYC re-verification

## 🎯 Governance Model

### Voting Structure
- **1 NFT = 1 Vote** (max 10% control per wallet)
- **Operational Decisions**: Maintenance, repairs, contractor selection (<€5k)
- **Strategic Decisions**: Property acquisition/disposal (90% quorum required >€20k)
- **Automatic Voting**: Non-participation handled via default rules

### Participation Requirements
- **Active Voting Expected**: Sanctions for repeated non-participation
- **KYC Mandatory**: All voting requires verified identity
- **Community Buyback**: 12-month inactivity triggers fair market buyout
