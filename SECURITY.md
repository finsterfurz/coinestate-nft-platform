# üîí Security Policy

## CoinEstate NFT Platform Security

This document outlines the security measures, policies, and procedures for the CoinEstate NFT Platform.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Framework

### Core Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for users and systems
3. **Zero Trust**: Verify all interactions regardless of source
4. **Secure by Design**: Security built into every component
5. **Transparency**: Clear security policies and incident reporting

### Web3 Security Measures

- **Smart Contract Auditing**: All contracts undergo professional security audits
- **Multi-signature Wallets**: Critical operations require multiple approvals
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against automated attacks
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery prevention

## üîê Implementation Details

### Input Validation & Sanitization

```javascript
// All user inputs are validated using Joi schemas
import { walletAddressSchema, validateAndSanitize } from './utils/validation';

const result = validateAndSanitize(userInput, walletAddressSchema);
if (!result.isValid) {
  throw new Error(result.error);
}
```

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

Our CSP headers prevent XSS attacks:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net; ...
```

### Environment Security

- Production runs HTTPS only
- Environment variables are properly secured
- No sensitive data in client-side code
- CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations
