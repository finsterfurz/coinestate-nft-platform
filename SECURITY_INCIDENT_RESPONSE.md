### üõ†Ô∏è Response Procedures

#### **Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes)**
1. **Isolate the threat**
   ```bash
   # Emergency circuit breaker for smart contracts
   curl -X POST https://api.coinestate.io/v1/emergency/pause \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $EMERGENCY_TOKEN" \
        -d '{"reason": "security_incident", "severity": "critical"}'
   ```

2. **Notify response team**
   ```bash
   # Automated alert system
   ./scripts/security-alert.sh \
     --severity=critical \
     --incident="Smart contract exploit detected" \
     --affected-users=500
   ```

3. **Preserve evidence**
   ```bash
   # Capture system state
   kubectl logs -n production deployment/web3-backend > incident-logs.txt
   ```

#### **Investigation Phase (15 minutes - 2 hours)**
1. **Forensic Analysis**
   - Blockchain transaction analysis
   - Server log examination
   - Network traffic analysis
   - User behavior pattern review

2. **Impact Assessment**
   - Affected user count
   - Financial impact estimation
   - Reputation damage assessment
   - Legal implications review

#### **Containment Phase (2-6 hours)**
1. **Technical Containment**
   ```bash
   # Pause affected smart contract functions
   ./scripts/emergency-pause.sh --contract=governance --function=voting
   
   # Rate limit suspicious IPs
   ./scripts/rate-limit.sh --ip-range=suspicious --limit=1req/hour
   
   # Rotate compromised API keys
   ./scripts/rotate-keys.sh --scope=all --priority=high
   ```

2. **Communication Strategy**
   - Internal team notification
   - User communication (if needed)
   - Regulatory body notification (if required)
   - Media statement preparation

#### **Recovery Phase (6-24 hours)**
1. **System Restoration**
   ```bash
   # Deploy security patches
   ./scripts/deploy-emergency-patch.sh --version=security-fix-v1.2.3
   
   # Restore services gradually
   ./scripts/gradual-restore.sh --percentage=10 --monitor=true
   ```

2. **Verification**
   - Security testing on restored systems
   - User access verification
   - Transaction integrity checks
   - Smart contract functionality validation

#### **Post-Incident Phase (24-72 hours)**
1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Technical vulnerability assessment
   - Process failure identification
   - Human error analysis
   - Timeline reconstruction

2. **Improvement Implementation**
   - Code fixes deployment
   - Process improvements
   - Team training updates
   - Monitoring enhancements
